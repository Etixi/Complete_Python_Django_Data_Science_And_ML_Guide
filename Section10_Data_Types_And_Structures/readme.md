### **Rules For Working With Variables**

+ Always choose `meaningful` names.
+ In variable names,use a noun, such as `name, comments, new_photos`.
+ Names of functions and methods begin with a verb, for example `get_data, create_request, merge_names`.

### **Types and Data Structures Overview**

+ There are `no primitive types` in python.
+ There are `mutable` and `immutable` objects in python.
+ Types of immutable objects:

    + String : str
    + boolean : bool
    + integer : int
    + decimal numbers : float
    + tuple : tuple
    + None : NoneType

+ Types of `mutable` objects:

    + list : list
    + dictionary : dict
    + set : set
    + user_defined classes
